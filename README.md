## Project Description

In this project, I focused on consuming and working with data from public APIs.

As a vehicle for learning this concepts, I selected the Twiiter API and worked to re-construct a simplified version of the website's existing UI using their own API. 

I also worked with the OAuth protocol to authenticate users with the third-party provider, and used various testing techniques to allow us to test against the third-party data.

## <a name="learning-goals"></a> Learning Goals

* Learn to consume data from third-party APIs
* Continue to emphasize performance, UI, and overall user experience
* Continue using TDD to drive all layers of development
* Coordinate with project stakeholders to produce quality code and product
* This project will be completed individually over a period of 4 days.

## <a name="technical-expectations"></a> Technical Expectations

* Use an Omniauth authentication library for authenticating users with the 3rd-party service.
* Mimic the interface functionality of one online service from the list below.
* Consume an external API to get real data and interact with a third-party service.

### Twitter

Build a basic version of the Twitter feed. As a user, I should be able to:

* Authenticate with my Twitter account
* View a list of recent tweets from my feed
* See my basic profile information (profile pic, follower count, following count, etc)
* Post a tweet
* Favorite a tweet

Extensions:

* Retweeting a tweet
* Replying to a tweet
* Use a paginated or infinite-scroll interface to view more tweets
* Unfollow a user
